some of the text editors

 Every computer will come with its own text editor. On Mac computers, the text editor that comes with your computer is called,
 “Text Edit.” On Windows computers, the text editor that comes with your computer is called, “Notepad.”

While you certainly can use Notepad and Text Edit to make websites, there are other text editors available that might help you code more
efficiently. I invite you to judge for yourself and form your own opinions.

So, some of text editors currently installed and some you need to install it.Notpad in one of the installed editors.
but Notpad++ is not, that the deffirent.

Lets speak about some editors that can be used in web development :

## The Difference Between Text Editors and IDEs

#### IDEs -which known as (Integrated Development Environment)-is a text editor, a file manager, a compiler, and a debugger all in one software package.While you might not be ready, or have the need to use a compiler, or a debugger when you’re just starting out in web development, you’ll get to see how an IDE operates in your text editing software. When you’re ready to use an IDE, you’ll be more confident in how to use it because you’ll already had some experience with it by using your text editor.



##### The Older Coder :
> So, I’ll start using that updated text editor for a while, and in the meanwhile, the others will be updated. So, I’ll start using those ones.

### The End.
