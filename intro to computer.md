# How Computers Work

## 1. What make a computer, a computer ?
### the computer do four main task, it takes input, store information, process it and then output the result. these four things is common in all computers. The old computers was made of wood and metal with gears. by 20s century starts to use electrical components and was take to take an hours to do basia math problem.
### Computers starts only as calculators, at the time was awosem but nowadays it do many many different things. we can use them to call each other, play vedio game and control robot.

1. Input :
    1. mouse
    2. keyboared
    3. microphone
    4. camera
    5. touch screen

2. Storation ( Memory) : <br>
 All these different inputs stored in memory and the **Processor** takes information from memory and process it with allgorithm which a series of commands.

3. Processing :<br>
The processor send back the processed information to the memory.

4. Output : <br>
the infomation comes out when it needed in different ways. it can be on screen or signal to robot or even input to another computer

## 2. Binary and Data:<br>

### Ones and Zeros is the language that computer actually have.Inside the computer there are wires and circuits carry all information in a computer. To represent infomation, its actually about on of off in the wires and circuits. in the wire "on and off" transfer through the wire and it called a **bit** which the smallest inforamtion computer can store.
### The Binary number system:<br>
### Its just two digits zero and one. Any number can be represented with binary number system and more wires you use, more numbers can represented.
### You can also represent text, images and sounds.For **text** each letter can be represented to its binary number. for **images** each pixel has RGB and evry color has number which can be converted to binary number. Fpr sounds its have vibrations which are about wavefomrs have numeric values which can represented into binary numbers.

## 3. Circuit and Logic :

### In order to represent the infomation whether input or output you **circuit** which is million of electric components. The circuit tkae the electric signal and flip it to ON or OFF and so on. To flip the data to binary you need logic gates such as AND OR gates.

## Why the smallest computer is faster :<br>
### because the small circuit is, the short distance electric signal need to go.

## 4. Hardware and Sofware :

### Hardware and Software work together where the CPU control Each piece in the computer and hardware. the **CPU** has circuits for logic and  math, send and recieve information to and from different parts of computer. CPU dtermines which  part which now running or will be running by binary code. You don't need to write the code becuase its takes forever you just need to use programming language.this programming language is called **Software** which tells the CPU what to do.But when you have many software works together here comes something called **Operating System** which is the master progran that manages how software uses the hardware of a computer or in sorth it determines which program should works according to your choice and switching between them on demands.<br><br><br><br>
