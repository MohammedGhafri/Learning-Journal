# Comparision operators :
### The result will be **true** or **false**

Symbole | Its Name | Task
-------|---------------|----------
==|Is equal to ?|This operator compare two values  to see if they are the same.
!=|Is Not Equal to | This operator compare two values  to see if they are **not** the same.
===|Strict equal to|This operator compare two values to check that the both data and values are the same.
!==| Strict equal to| This operator compare two values to check that the both data and values are **not** the same.
> | Greater than | This operator checks if the number on the left is **greater** than the number on the right.
< | Less Than | This operator checks if the number on the left is **less** than the number on the right.
>= | Greater than or equal | This operator checks if the number on the left is **greater than or equal** the number on the right.
<= | Less than or equal | This operator checks if the number on the left is **less than or equal** the number on the right.


# Logical operators :
### Comparision operators usaully return single values of true or false.While logical operators allow you to campare the resultd of more  than one  comparision operator.

Symbole | Its Name | Task
-------|---------------|----------
&& | Logical And | Test more than one condition and return true if all conditions are true.
`||` |Logical OR | Test more than one condition and return true if one condition is true.
! | Logical Not | This operator takes a single boolean value  and inverts it.

# Loops : 
### Loops check the condition if it return true , a code block will run.
### Two Type of loops : <br>
1. `for` Loop: if you know the number of repetition
2. `while` loop: if you don't know the number of repetition
3. `do while` loop : run the statement at least one time.
